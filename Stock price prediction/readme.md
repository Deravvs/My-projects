# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM and ARIMA Models

## Overview
This project predicts future stock prices using **machine learning (LSTM)** and **statistical (ARIMA)** models. It demonstrates time-series forecasting, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, with a focus on financial applications.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Models**:
  - **LSTM Neural Network**: Deep learning model for capturing complex patterns in stock data.
  - **ARIMA**: Statistical baseline for time-series forecasting.
- **Technical Indicators**: Includes moving averages and RSI for feature engineering.
- **Evaluation**: Compares model performance using RMSE and visualizations.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Time-series analysis
- Machine learning (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Statistical modeling (ARIMA)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib)
- Python programming (Pandas, NumPy)
