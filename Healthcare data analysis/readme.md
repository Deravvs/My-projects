This project was excecuted  by myself and a group of data analysts, I was appointed the project leader.
The aim of the project was to analyze the hospital's data and bring meaningful insights on doctor performance, operations effeiciency and patients review and recovery.
I distributed the tasks amongst us and my own task was too design the dashboard, we all contributed and shares our observations on the project.
After the analysis we created a power point presentation which was presented to the supervisors; explaining our observation and recommendations.
